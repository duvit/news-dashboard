# NewsDashboard

A Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular to display and filter articles from an open API.

## Test Task Implementation

**Features:**

- **Home Page:** Article cards with titles and truncated descriptions (100 characters). Clicking opens a full article page.
- **Keyword Filter:** Filter articles by title and description; matched keywords highlighted in yellow.

**Notes / Desired Improvements:**

- Field priority (`name` matches > `description` matches) not implemented due to API limitations.
- Styles are basic; could be refined for a cleaner, more responsive UI.

## Deployment

### Development server

```bash
ng serve
```
